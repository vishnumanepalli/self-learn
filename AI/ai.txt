Moore's Law:
Increase of computer power for same cost by timeline 
in 18-24 months computer power increases by 2 times for same cost

Plan of Attack:
1) Reinforcement Learning
2) Bellman Equation
3) The 'Plan'
4) Markov Decision Process(MDP)
5) Policy vs Plan
6) Adding a living Penalty
7) Q-Learning Intuition
8) Temporal difference
9) Q-Learning Visualization

Reinforcement Learning:
> Environment: where AI will train and build
> Agent is AI or mind
> Agent do actions and get reward for that
> Based on it, it will learn 
> Don't have any algorithm and let reinforcement algorithm let it figure out on it's own.
> Reinforced algorithms work sometimes better than pre programmed dogs
> reinforced dogs can play soccer if env and actions are specified.

Bellman Equation:
s -> state
a -> action
R -> reward +1/0/-1
gamma -> discount
v -> value
v(s) = max(a) [R(s,a) + gamma * v(s')]
s' = new state
